These are mostly related to us upgrading our dependency on [nhsuk-frontend to v4](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#400---26-october-2020) which also includes some breaking changes.\\n\\n## New Card Component\\n\\nThe new Card component from `nhsuk-frontend` 4 has been added. Check out the storybook for usage examples!\\n\\n## Warning Callout\\n\\n### Removal of Warning Callout `label` prop\\n\\nThe WarningCallout `label` prop has been removed, and replaced with `WarningCallout.Label`.\\n\\nExisting usages of the WarningCallout will need to be replaced with the new syntax, or will no longer render properly.\\n\\n```jsx\\n// Old Syntax\\n<WarningCallout label=\\\"School, nursery or work\\\">\\n  <p>\\n    Stay away from school, nursery or work until all the spots have crusted over.\\n    This is usually 5 days after the spots first appeared.\\n  </p>\\n</WarningCallout>\\n\\n// New Syntax\\n<WarningCallout>\\n  <WarningCallout.Label>School, nursery or work</WarningCallout.Label>\\n  <p>\\n    Stay away from school, nursery or work until all the spots have crusted over.\\n    This is usually 5 days after the spots first appeared.\\n  </p>\\n</WarningCallout>\\n```\\n\\n### Addition of hidden text on the Warning Callout Label\\n\\nThe `WarningCallout.Label` now has the hidden text `Important: ` before the label content. If this causes an issue in your application, and you would like to change or disable this hidden text you are able to do via the `visuallyHiddenText` prop.\\n\\n```jsx\\n// Custom Visually Hidden Text\\n<WarningCallout.Label visuallyHiddenText=\\\"This is very, very important: \\\">\\n  Something Quite Important\\n</WarningCallout.Label>\\n\\n// Disabled Visually Hidden Text\\n<WarningCallout.Label visuallyHiddenText={false}>\\n  Something Much Less Important\\n</WarningCallout.Label>\\n```\\n\\n## Hint component renders as div\\n\\nThe `Hint` component now renders as a `div` element rather than a `span`.\\n\\n## Deprecation of Panel & Promo Components\\n\\nThe `Panel` and `Promo` components have been removed from `nhsuk-frontend` since version 4.0.0. As a result, we have deprecated these components. These components work exactly as they did before, with the only difference being a slightly different import.\\n\\n```jsx\\n// Old Imports\\nimport { Button, Panel, Promo } from \\\"nhsuk-react-components\\\";\\n\\n// New Imports\\nimport { Button } from \\\"nhsuk-react-components\\\";\\nimport { Panel, Promo } from \\\"nhsuk-react-components/dist/deprecated\\\";\\n```\\n\\nA warning is printed to the console in dev environments when using these components, as they are set to be removed in the next major release.\\n\\n## Date component input type has changed\\n\\nIn line with the upstream nhsuk-frontend, NHS Design Kit and GDS recommendations, we now render the input boxes in the date component as follows:\\n\\n```html\\n<input type=\\\"text\\\" inputType=\\\"numeric\\\" pattern=\\\"[0-9]*\\\">\\n```\\n\\nThere is more on this change here:\\n\\n- [NHSDigital/nhsuk-react-components#108](https://github.com/NHSDigital/nhsuk-react-components/pull/108)\\n- [nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend#666](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/pull/666)\\n- https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2020/02/24/why-the-gov-uk-design-system-team-changed-the-input-type-for-numbers/\\n\"","import Docs from \"../../docs/upgrade-to-2.0.md?raw\"\nimport {Markdown, Meta} from \"@storybook/blocks\"\n\n<Meta title=\"Migration Guides/Upgrade to 2.0\" />\n\n<Markdown>{Docs}</Markdown>"],"names":["Docs","MDXContent","props","MDXLayout","_provideComponents","_jsx","_createMdxContent","_jsxs","_Fragment","Meta","Markdown"],"mappings":"qYAAA,MAAeA,EAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,ECKf,SAASC,EAAWC,EAAQ,GAAI,CAC9B,KAAM,CAAC,QAASC,CAAS,EAAI,OAAO,OAAO,CAAE,EAAEC,EAAoB,EAAEF,EAAM,UAAU,EACrF,OAAOC,EAAYE,EAAKF,EAAW,OAAO,OAAO,CAAE,EAAED,EAAO,CAC1D,SAAUG,EAAKC,EAAmB,EAAE,CACxC,CAAG,CAAC,EAAIA,IACN,SAASA,GAAoB,CAC3B,OAAOC,EAAMC,EAAW,CACtB,SAAU,CAACH,EAAKI,EAAM,CACpB,MAAO,iCACf,CAAO,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMJ,EAAKK,EAAU,CACvB,SAAUV,CAClB,CAAO,CAAC,CACR,CAAK,CACF,CACH"}
