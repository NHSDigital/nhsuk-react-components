## Coming from 0.x?

If you're coming from versions of the library prior to 1.0.0, please give [this doc](/docs/upgrade-to-1.0.md) a brief read, as there a number of changes between 0.x release and the 1.0 release.

## Upgrading to 2.0

If you're upgrading to 2.0, please be aware we have made some breaking changes. [This doc](/docs/upgrade-to-2.0.md) has the details.

## Installation

You can install this package using either `yarn` or `npm`.

```bash
npm install --save nhsuk-react-components
# Or
yarn add nhsuk-react-components
```

## Usage

```jsx
import React, { PureComponent } from 'react';

// You can import components from the global module
import { Button } from 'nhsuk-react-components';

// Or you can import components directly
import Button from 'nhsuk-react-components/lib/components/button';

class GetStartedButton extends PureComponent {
  render() {
    return <Button>Click Me!</Button>;
  }
}
```

## Preparing Releases

Releases run in CI using github actions.

To prepare a release create a new release TAG in github with your release version.

> `NPM_TOKEN` should be stored in the repositories [secrets in GitHub](https://github.com/NHSDigital/nhsuk-react-components/settings/secrets/actions)

- Create a new release with a tag like `major.minor.patch` against main.
- If the change is a `beta` then select `pre-release` as true, this will make the `tag` point at `beta`. Otherwise the tag will be `latest`.
